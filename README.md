# gorm example

CRUD: create, read, update, delete. the functionality that needs to be present in a database.

REST: the server has endpoints that define what resources are being requested. e.g. fetch(API_ADDR + "/users") would return an array of JSON objects containing user info, and fetch(API_ADDR + "/users" + userid) would return a JSON object of a single user.
